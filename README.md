# Bachelors_Thesis
Files and scripts involved in my Bachelor's Thesis of the Mechanical Engineering Program at UFSC


**1. Subject, topic**: Implementation of a Deep Neural Network for the correction of plasticity effects in the hole drilling method for measuring residual stress in flexible risers

(Oil & Gas Industry)

**2. Motivation**: working with ANN (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), FEA, Simulation with Ansys APDL, mechanical metrology, residual stress, the ASTM E837-13a.

**3. Those involved in the project**: 
- Advisor:    Prof. Armando Albertazzi Gon√ßalves Jr, Dr. Eng.; 
- Co-advisor: Matias Roberto Viotti, Dr. Eng.; 
- Co-advisor: Thiago Wilvert, Me. Eng.

**7. Company involved**: Metrology and Measurement Automation Laboratory - LABMETRO/EMC/UFSC

**8. Steps**:
  - Study ASTM E837-13a and its limitations regarding the effects of plasticity (State of the art)
  - Develop simulation model considering plasticity effects
  - From simulated results establish neural network database
  - Train and validate neural network models 
  - Build and test different deep learning models, CNN, RNN, others (State of the art) 

*** Python files will be released after June 2021.
