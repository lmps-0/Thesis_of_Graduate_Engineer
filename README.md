# Bachelors_Thesis
Files and scripts involved in my Bachelor's Thesis of the Mechanical Engineering Program at UFSC


1. **Subject, topic**: Implementation of a (Deep) Neural Network for the correction of plasticity effects in the hole drilling method for measuring residual stress
2. **Motivation**: working with ANN (Machine Learning, Deep Learning), FEA, Simulation with Ansys APDL, mechanical metrology ASTM E837
3. **Those involved in the project**: 
- Prof. Armando Albertazzi Gonçalves Jr, Dr. Eng.; 
- Matias Roberto Viotti, Dr. Eng.; 
- Thiago Wilvert, Me. Eng.
7. **Company involved**: Metrology and Measurement Automation Laboratory - LABMETRO/EMC/UFSC
8. **Steps**:
  - Study ASTM E837 and its limitations regarding the effects of plasticity (State of the art)
  - Develop simulation model considering plasticity effects
  - From simulated results establish neural network database
  - Train and validate neural network models 
  - Build and test different deep learning models, CNN, RNN, others (State of the art)
